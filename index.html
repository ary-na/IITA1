      <p>My name is Arian Najafi Yamchelo, and I am from Iran. My family and I have migrated to Melbourne, Australia 10 years ago. I did graduate from high school in Iran before moving out. Considering English is my second language (I speak Farsi and Turkish), I had to study a couple of certificates in spoken and written English upon arrival in Australia. Besides that, I have completed a Certificate IV in programming. Also attempted a Diploma of Software Development however I had to withdraw due to an unfortunate medical condition.</p>
      <p>When I have the time, I like to play video games and workout at my local gym. being an animal lover, I have got three pet dogs named Sunny, Heeva (German Shepherds) and Teddy (Samoyed) plus one pet cat named Barfi (Persian Cat).</p>
      <p>An interesting fact about me; As a kid growing up my passion was always to become a truck driver, not so much of a passion anymore however, it is still my interest.</p>

      <h2>MY INTREST IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</h2>
      <p>I am interested in game development and I always wanted to work with popular gaming studios and hopefully, one day have my game studio to create AAA games for different gaming platforms. Besides, I am passionate about HTML and CSS.</p>
      <p>My oldest brother is a computer hardware engineer and I’ve been grown up seeing all kinds of different technology and computers. I used to play games with his personal computer when he is not around. For me installing a game and playing it meant all the world especially when I could install a game without getting a random error.
</p>
<p>
The first laptop I have received was from my brother for my birthday. it was his old MacBook Pro 2006 model. This was the first personal computer that I owned. With it, I started a weblog in a blogging platform (which cease to exist) about WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) and had roughly 500 views daily. There were a template selector and template code editor built into the platform. It allowed the users to change any part of the template using the code editor. I did change the colour and font of the template and found it compelling to change or add a piece of code and see the result. I started researching how to make more changes to make my weblog more appealing and I did. Every day I spent the majority of my time playing around with the code and that affected my grades in school though I learned a lot and have no regrets.</p>

      <h2>RMIT</h2>
      <p>Coding is my passion therefore I always wanted to pursue my passion as a software developer more specifically a game developer, thus I started looking for places to start my study and researching about universities and colleges that would let me study Information Technology. Often responsibilities and commitments didn’t allow me to study full time or even part-time in university. Consequently, I found out about RMIT offering a Bachelor of IT, and I didn’t want to lose the chance to study in one of the best universities in Melbourne, so I had to enrol.</p>

    <h1>PROJECT IDEA</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="sectionContent">
    <article>
      <h2>SIDE SCROLLER 2D GAME</h2>
      <h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
      <p>This project is a 2D side scroller, a single level game developed using Unity Engine.</p>
      <p>The game will move from left to right of the screen. The playable character will stay in the middle of the screen at all times while the background keeps moving. The view of the camera is a side view of the world and the main character. This game will feature the main playable character that can run, jump and avoid dangers (enemies etc.).</p>
      <p>It will consist of one level, and the player will receive a message upon completion congratulating them.</p>
      <h3>MOTIVATION</h3>
      <p>The gaming industry is one of the biggest and most exciting industries in IT. Not so much for a 2D game anymore but it is a starting point for me. Developing a game although as simple as a 2D side scroller game excites me and motivates me at the same time.</p>
      <h3>PROJECTS DESCRIPTION</h3>
      <p>The game is a 2D side scroller, single-level game. Featuring a main character that will remain in the middle of the screen while the background will move backwards or forward, creating an illusion that the character is moving forward or backwards.</p>
      <p>
The level is a platformer design meaning the playable character is only allowed to walk or jump on the platforms otherwise, it is going to fall, and the game will restart.</p>
<p>
Each part of the level will have a unique design, challenges to overcome and will get more challenging as the players get closer to the end of the level therefore keeping the player engaged and motivated.</p>
<p>
Hidden platforms containing special coins will exist for players who like to explore.</p>
<p>Players will have to jump over obstacles and objects placed in the level to finish the level.</p>
<p>The main character can jump over the obstacles and jump on top of enemies to kill them. It also can walk forward and backwards in case of missed coins.</p>
<p>Walking or jumping through the coins will grant every coin that the character touches.</p>
<p>The character can be killed upon touching the enemies or falling off the platform.</p>
<p>Enemies to be placed all over the level in different positions along with the ability to move to the left or right. The appearance of each enemy may vary.
</p>
<p>Coins will be placed all over the level especially in hard-to-reach places to challenge the player to try and get every single coin during the level.</p>
<p>The game will restart from the beginning upon deaths for retry.</p>
<p>Upon completing the level acquiring all of the coins, the player will receive a special message.</p>
<h3>ANIMATION</h3>
<p>Use of animation to give the game more depth and life.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The main playable character: Walking and jumping animation</li>
  <li>The enemies: Moving animation</li>
  <li>Coins: Rotating animation</li>
  <li>Background: Sky and clouds moving as the character moves</li>
</ul>
<h3>SOUND</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Falling off a platform</li>
  <li>Touching an enemy</li>
  <li>Collecting coins</li>
  <li>Completing the level while obtaining all the coins triggers another special sound effect
alongside a special message letting the player know they have all the coins.</li>
</ul>
<h3>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS</h3>
<ul>
  <li>HD video: The game will support a widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio to fit the entire widescreen picture.</li>
  <li>Surround sound: stereo surround sound supported through analogue connection.</li>
  <li>Multiplayer feature: Single-player game</li>
  <li>Portable gaming feature: not supported</li>
  <li>Hardware support: Mobile game</li>

<h2>OUTCOME</h2>

The players have to restart the game upon falling off a platform or being hit by an enemy throughout the level. The level consists of obstacles and objects that players have to overcome to be able to finish the level. Each action will have its specific sound effect for instance collecting coin will have a different sound effect than falling off a platform.</p>
